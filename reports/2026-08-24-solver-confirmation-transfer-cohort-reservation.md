# Solver confirmation/transfer cohort reservation

> **Status:** active
> **Last evidence:** 2026-08-25 — completed `confirm-broad-001` run `32908734154` and `confirm-broad-002` run `32912881453`
> **Decision:** broad confirmation has now completed two real one-use lifecycles. `confirm-broad-001` and `confirm-broad-002` are spent; `transfer-envelope-001` remains locked and untouched because neither candidate survived broad confirmation. Future candidates need a newly reserved broad successor before confirmation.
> **Remaining gate:** reserve a fresh broad-confirmation successor before the next tuned candidate reaches confirmation; materialize `transfer-envelope-001` only after a candidate passes broad confirmation.
> **Evidence role:** discovery
> **Selection:** prespecified cohort lifecycle; each confirmation candidate, work envelope, and acceptance rule was frozen before its cohort was materialized

## Lifecycle now exercised

The reservation mechanism has moved from paper design to working evidence discipline.

### `confirm-broad-001` — SPENT

- 256 ordinary raised-cap generated levels;
- generator revision `4f2b2b143ee2bc194b8e017fcc59a680b9ee8d92`;
- master seed `2026082417`, IDs `C00001` onward;
- candidate: global suppression of ordinary-main-loop `dfs:objectiveFirst` and `dfs:intersectionHarvest`;
- final valid run `32908734154`;
- result: **140/256 → 141/256**, **+3/-2**, work -0.22%;
- verdict: failed frozen zero-loss gate.

The first attempts exposed an infrastructure lesson: independently invoking the pinned generator with the same seed did not guarantee byte-identical cohort wrappers, and deeper generation behavior could not safely be assumed reproducible across separate jobs. The valid workflow therefore materialized the cohort **once**, sealed the `levels` hash, and made every arm download and verify the same artifact before search. That single-specimen pattern is now the required confirmation contract.

### `confirm-broad-002` — SPENT

Reserved fresh before materialization because `confirm-broad-001` was already spent:

- 256 ordinary raised-cap generated levels;
- same pinned generator revision;
- master seed `2026082517`, IDs `D00001` onward;
- candidate: selective exposure of `beam:intersectionHarvest@beam5000(diverse)` in the two existing very-high-intersection policy bundles when `mustCross < 2`;
- final run `32912881453`;
- result: **126/256 → 126/256**, **0 gains / 0 losses**, treatment work about +0.01%;
- verdict: failed frozen gate as a clean null.

See [`2026-08-25-diverse-ih-confirm-broad-002-freeze.md`](2026-08-25-diverse-ih-confirm-broad-002-freeze.md).

### `transfer-envelope-001` — LOCKED / UNTOUCHED

- role: transfer/challenge;
- size: 256 independent generated levels;
- generator revision: `4f2b2b143ee2bc194b8e017fcc59a680b9ee8d92`;
- mode: `--envelope-caps`;
- master seed: `2026082429`;
- IDs on materialization: `T00001` onward;
- outcome conditioning: none.

It remains unmaterialized because neither broad-confirmation candidate passed. Do not spend it merely because it exists.

From the pinned generator checkout, its reserved recipe remains:

```bash
node scripts/run-bundled.mjs scripts/stress/generate-random.mjs \
  --envelope-caps \
  --count=256 \
  --master-seed=2026082429 \
  --id-prefix=T \
  --out=tmp/managed-evaluation/transfer-envelope-001.json
```

## Durable confirmation contract

Before any future decision-bearing confirmation:

1. select/tune only on development evidence;
2. freeze solver revision, exact treatment, total work envelope, primary outcome, correctness rule, gains/loss rule, and pass/fail criterion;
3. reserve a fresh cohort identity before materialization or inspection;
4. generate the cohort exactly once from its pinned source revision;
5. seal the generated `levels` content and give every arm that exact artifact;
6. verify cohort seal and treatment provenance before search;
7. record the aggregate verdict before inspecting changed IDs or traces;
8. mark the cohort spent after that one decision-bearing use;
9. if exact failures influence redesign, treat them as development evidence and reserve another successor.

Seeds and recipes may remain public for reproducibility. Freshness comes from non-use and non-inspection for candidate design, not secrecy.

## Relationship to existing corpora

Corpus 2, technique census, variant families, and spent confirmation cohorts are all development evidence for future hypothesis generation once they have influenced design. Level-blindness within those populations does not restore holdout status.

The two failed confirmations are themselves valuable evidence: both treatments looked positive on repeatedly studied development data, and neither survived a fresh broad cohort. Independent confirmation is therefore a demonstrated requirement for broad promotion claims in this project.

## Next reservation

No third broad cohort is reserved in this report. Reserve its identity only when a new candidate is approaching confirmation, before its exact generated rows are inspected. The current queue puts equal-work restart/continuation ahead of another mined portfolio treatment, so a future residual-confirmation cohort may require a separately frozen baseline-membership contract rather than another unconditional broad sample.
